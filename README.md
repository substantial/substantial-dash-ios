# Substantial Dash iOS client (a.k.a. Dexr)

**An early work-in-progress** to visualize realtime events, statuses, and key performance indicators.

Designed to display data from [Substantial Dash server](https://github.com/substantial/substantial-dash-server).

## Tech

* [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa): functional reactive patterns in Objective-C
* [Bayeux/Faye events](https://github.com/m1entus/MZFayeClient): publish & subscribe to data streams
* [Kiwi](https://github.com/kiwi-bdd/Kiwi): behavior-driven, RSpec-style testing

### Requirements

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
* [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)

### Boot-up

    git clone git@github.com:substantial/substantial-dash-ios.git
    cd substantial-dash-ios/
